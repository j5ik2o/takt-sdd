        The design review-fix cycle has repeated {cycle_count} times.

        **Reports to reference:**
        - Design review: {report:design-review.md}

        **Evaluation criteria:**
        - Are new issues being discovered and fixed in each cycle?
        - Are the same findings being repeated?
