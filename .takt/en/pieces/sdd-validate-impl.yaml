        **Reports to reference:**
        - Architecture review: {report:05-architect-review.md}
        - QA review: {report:06-qa-review.md}
        - Implementation validation: {report:07-impl-validation.md}

        **Evaluation criteria:**
        - Are new issues being discovered and fixed in each cycle?
        - Are the same findings being repeated?
